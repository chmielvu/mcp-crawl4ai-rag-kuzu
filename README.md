<p align="center">
  <em>Web Crawling and RAG Capabilities for AI Agents and AI Coding Assistants</em>
</p>

A powerful implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) integrated with [Crawl4AI](https://crawl4ai.com), [Kuzu](https://kuzudb.com/), [Mistral AI](https://docs.mistral.ai/), and [FlashRank](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/FlashRank) for advanced web crawling and RAG.

With this MCP server, you can <b>scrape anything</b> and then <b>use that knowledge anywhere</b> for RAG.

This refactor keeps the MCP surface while moving the project to an embedded Kuzu graph + vector store, Mistral models for embeddings and summaries, and FlashRank for local reranking.

## Overview

This MCP server provides tools that enable AI agents to crawl websites, store content in an embedded Kuzu database, and perform RAG over the crawled content. It follows the same MCP tool model as before while making local execution much simpler because the storage layer now lives inside the project instead of a separate hosted database.

The server includes several advanced RAG strategies that can be enabled to enhance retrieval quality:
- **Contextual Embeddings** for enriched semantic understanding
- **Hybrid Search** combining vector and keyword search
- **Agentic RAG** for specialized code example extraction
- **Reranking** for improved result relevance using FlashRank

See the [Configuration section](#configuration) below for details on how to enable and configure these strategies.

## Vision

The Crawl4AI RAG MCP server is just the beginning. Here's where we're headed:

1. **Integration with Archon**: Building this system directly into [Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) to create a comprehensive knowledge engine for AI coding assistants to build better AI agents.

2. **Multiple Embedding Models**: The current default provider is Mistral AI, with the architecture now centered around pluggable local storage and cleaner retrieval boundaries.

3. **Advanced RAG Strategies**: Implementing sophisticated retrieval techniques like contextual retrieval, late chunking, and others to move beyond basic "naive lookups" and significantly enhance the power and precision of the RAG system, especially as it integrates with Archon.

4. **Enhanced Chunking Strategy**: Implementing a Context 7-inspired chunking approach that focuses on examples and creates distinct, semantically meaningful sections for each chunk, improving retrieval precision.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Increasing crawling and indexing speed to make it more realistic to "quickly" index new documentation to then leverage it within the same prompt in an AI coding assistant.

## Features

- **Smart URL Detection**: Automatically detects and handles different URL types (regular webpages, sitemaps, text files)
- **Recursive Crawling**: Follows internal links to discover content
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently crawls multiple pages simultaneously
- **Content Chunking**: Intelligently splits content by headers and size for better processing
- **Vector Search**: Performs RAG over crawled content, optionally filtering by data source for precision
- **Source Retrieval**: Retrieve sources available for filtering to guide the RAG process

## Tools

The server provides essential web crawling and search tools:

### Core Tools (Always Available)

1. **`crawl_single_page`**: Quickly crawl a single web page and store its content in Kuzu
2. **`smart_crawl_url`**: Intelligently crawl a full website based on the type of URL provided (sitemap, llms-full.txt, or a regular webpage that needs to be crawled recursively)
3. **`get_available_sources`**: Get a list of all available sources (domains) in the database
4. **`perform_rag_query`**: Search for relevant content using semantic search with optional source filtering

### Conditional Tools

5. **`search_code_examples`** (requires `USE_AGENTIC_RAG=true`): Search specifically for code examples and their summaries from crawled documentation. This tool provides targeted code snippet retrieval for AI coding assistants.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment and dependency management
- A [Mistral AI API key](https://docs.mistral.ai/developers/quickstarts/first-api-request)
- Optional: Docker if you want to containerize the server yourself

## Installation

### Using Docker

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-crawl4ai-rag.git
   cd mcp-crawl4ai-rag
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t mcp/crawl4ai-rag --build-arg PORT=8051 .
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the configuration section below

### Using uv directly

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-crawl4ai-rag.git
   cd mcp-crawl4ai-rag
   ```

2. Install uv if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv venv .venv --python 3.12
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # on Mac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

### RAG Strategy Options

The Crawl4AI RAG MCP server supports four powerful RAG strategies that can be enabled independently:

#### 1. **USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS**
When enabled, this strategy enhances each chunk's embedding with additional context from the entire document. The system passes both the full document and the specific chunk to an LLM (configured via `MODEL_CHOICE`) to generate enriched context that gets embedded alongside the chunk content.

- **When to use**: Enable this when you need high-precision retrieval where context matters, such as technical documentation where terms might have different meanings in different sections.
- **Trade-offs**: Slower indexing due to LLM calls for each chunk, but significantly better retrieval accuracy.
- **Cost**: Additional LLM API calls during indexing.

#### 2. **USE_HYBRID_SEARCH**
Combines keyword search and vector search, then merges them with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) for more comprehensive retrieval.

- **When to use**: Enable this when users might search using specific technical terms, function names, or when exact keyword matches are important alongside semantic understanding.
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly slower search queries but more robust results, especially for technical content.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs, just computational overhead.

#### 3. **USE_AGENTIC_RAG**
Enables specialized code example extraction and storage. When crawling documentation, the system identifies code blocks, extracts them with surrounding context, generates summaries with Mistral, and stores them in a dedicated Kuzu node table for code search.

- **When to use**: Essential for AI coding assistants that need to find specific code examples, implementation patterns, or usage examples from documentation.
- **Trade-offs**: Significantly slower crawling due to code extraction and summarization, requires more storage space.
- **Cost**: Additional LLM API calls for summarizing each code example.
- **Benefits**: Provides a dedicated `search_code_examples` tool that AI agents can use to find specific code implementations.

#### 4. **USE_RERANKING**
Applies FlashRank reranking to search results after initial retrieval. Uses a lightweight ONNX model (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2` by default) to score each result against the original query, then reorders results by relevance.

- **When to use**: Enable this when search precision is critical and you need the most relevant results at the top. Particularly useful for complex queries where semantic similarity alone might not capture query intent.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds ~100-200ms to search queries depending on result count, but significantly improves result ordering.
- **Cost**: No additional API costs - uses a local model that runs on CPU.
- **Benefits**: Better result relevance, especially for complex queries. Works with both regular RAG search and code example search.

### Recommended Configurations

**For general documentation RAG:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=true
```

**For AI coding assistant with code examples:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=true
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=true
USE_RERANKING=true
```

**For fast, basic RAG:**
```
USE_CONTEXTUAL_EMBEDDINGS=false
USE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
USE_AGENTIC_RAG=false
USE_RERANKING=false
```

## Running the Server

### Using Docker

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8051:8051 mcp/crawl4ai-rag
```

### Using Python

```bash
uv run crawl4ai-mcp
```

The server will start and listen on the configured host and port.

## Integration with MCP Clients

### SSE Configuration

Once you have the server running with SSE transport, you can connect to it using this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:8051/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note for Windsurf users**: Use `serverUrl` instead of `url` in your configuration:
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "crawl4ai-rag": {
>       "transport": "sse",
>       "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8051/sse"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> **Note for Docker users**: Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` if your client is running in a different container. This will apply if you are using this MCP server within n8n!

### Stdio Configuration

Add this server to your MCP configuration for Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or any other MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "crawl4ai-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "MISTRAL_API_KEY": "your_mistral_api_key",
        "KUZU_DB_PATH": "./data/kuzu_db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker with Stdio Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crawl4ai-rag": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", 
               "-e", "TRANSPORT", 
               "-e", "MISTRAL_API_KEY", 
               "-e", "KUZU_DB_PATH", 
               "mcp/crawl4ai"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "MISTRAL_API_KEY": "your_mistral_api_key",
        "KUZU_DB_PATH": "./data/kuzu_db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building Your Own Server

This implementation provides a foundation for building more complex MCP servers with web crawling capabilities. To build your own:

1. Add your own tools by creating methods with the `@mcp.tool()` decorator
2. Create your own lifespan function to add your own dependencies
3. Modify the `utils.py` file for any helper functions you need
4. Extend the crawling capabilities by adding more specialized crawlers
